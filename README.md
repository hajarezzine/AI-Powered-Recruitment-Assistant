## 🛠️ Tech Stack Deep Dive

### Core Components

1. **`app.py`** (Main Application)
   - Streamlit-powered UI with 3 sections:
     - Resume Analyzer
     - Interview Scheduler
     - About page
   - Handles all user interactions

2. **`utils/` (Core Modules)**
   - 📂 `config.py` - Job role configurations:
     ```python
     roles = {
         "Data Scientist": {
             "mandatory_skills": ["python", "machine learning"],
             "skills": ["sql", "data visualization"]
         }
     }
     ```
   - 🔍 `resume_parser.py` - PDF text extraction:
     - Uses PyPDF2 to parse resumes
     - Converts text to lowercase for case-insensitive matching

   - 🎥 `jitsi_scheduler.py` - Interview coordination:
     - Generates unique Jitsi meeting URLs
     - Sets default time to 24h from current time (UTC)

3. **📧 `email_sender.py`** - SMTP Email Service
   - Requires Gmail App Password (see setup below)
   - Sends formatted interview invites:
     ```
     Subject: Interview for {Role} at {Company}
     
     Dear Candidate,
     Your interview is scheduled for {Time}
     Join: {Jitsi Link}
     ```
